# SpecialCourse

In this repository you will find three .rmd's which are a part of the Rebilance Special Course Project. 

The order by which these files should be run is:
    "Gmodel"
    "Supplement"
    "UserReport"
A .pdf is also attached, which provides an outline of the project. 
Relevent packages must be installed before script can be run, see "packages.Rmd"
